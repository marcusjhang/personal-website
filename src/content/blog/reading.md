I've recently picked up a couple of technology books to read alongside my school work and internships. Mostly as a way for me to learn about engineering and technology.

I'm not an avid reader, apart from some biographies in the past.

One thing I hope to change since then is having a "Quality over Quantity" mindset towards reading. I hope to be able to hone in on a few topics which I know are applicable rather than have general knowledge over many topics.

The next thing I hope to do is to have an overview of the book before going into its details. I hope this keeps me interested and gives me a better idea of how different parts of the book are linked.

Third thing would be to freely write on the book. I'll keep some post-its and pens next to me when reading it. I hope this keeps my mind active. Not sure why I was always scared to just write on a hard copy book.

Last thing would be being patient. There's no rush to completing any book.
