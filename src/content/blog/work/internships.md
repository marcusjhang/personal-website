### In hopes I do not forget about my experiences in the near future.
I do internships to learn things aside from my school curriculum.

## Arrowster (May'24 to Aug'24)
- Did this on the NUS Overseas Colleges programme in Vietnam. Fun, eye-opening and gave me a good taste of start-up life.
- Managed to meet the smartest people from the best universities around the world üåç (Thanh, Kenneth, Arif, Jenny, Hayden. I miss you guys! ü´∂), and saw what real hard work looks like.
- Alot of my character, hard-work and tenacity towards work was built through this internship. Also realised how difficult it was to disrupt an industry (and how hard GTM was for a start-up).
- Did alot of miscellaneous tasks (e.g. Web-Scraping, QA, Data Analysis) which I did not enjoy then, but I appreciate now.
- My first introduction to Full-Stack Development, realised the joy of creation can be experienced even with a boring CS degree!
- Managed to get the role through sheer persistance and cold emailing. I appreciate my past self for doing that.

## CPF Board (Aug'24 to Dec'24)
- Did this Full-Time alongside my normal school workload. I learnt the importance of time and priority management, and got to experience working as an engineer in a larger firm.
- Realised my love for innovation teams within larger companies (My team's job!).
- Learnt about and appreciated the use of LLMs in automating menial tasks. LLMs and Software Development go hand in hand in many "innovative" projects.
- Learnt how good LLMs were in writing unfamiliar code. This however, made my code really messy. As an engineer, it was important to check the code I was "writing".
- Realised the importance of mentorship. Had the two best mentors I've had the privelage of meeting. I learnt almost everything I know now from them, technical and non-technical. (I ‚ù§Ô∏è you Eugene and Josh!)
- I had a self-coordinated mid-term review, and they gave me really good feedback I still hold dear to myself today. The best way to learn is to take it in your own hands.

## Binance (Dec'24 to May'25)
- Did this Full-Time remotely alongside my normal school workload. I miss having an office to go to.
- Started to appreciate Frontend Developers so much more. It was much more complex than I imagined.
- Realised how bad I was at coding after watching the full-time engineers do it. These were real engineers. People I wanted to be.
- Appreciated the way my manager managed to have such strong grip on a very dispersed team. Saw what real leadership can look like in Tech.
- Saw the biggest code bases I've seen in my life. Learnt to navigate through them with the help of the Full-Timers.
- Realised how bad ChatGPT was at being a real engineer with massive code bases (cursor too!). Learnt the importance of learning to think like an engineer. LLMs should only be used for modular tasks (eg Defining a component in React), the understanding must be done by the engineer.
- With a lack of an office, keeping myself accountable was very important too. Discipline is key when you aren't meeting your boss on a day-to-day basis.
- Remote != Easy/Slack ‚òπÔ∏è

## Millennium (May'25 to Aug'25)
- I'll be starting soon, attached to the Data Team!
